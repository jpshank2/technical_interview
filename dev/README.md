# Abacus Technologies Business Intelligence Developer Technical Interview

## Introduction

The mission of the Business Intelligence team at Abacus Technologies is to make business better with the use of data. Better can mean a lot of different things, but a key focus area for our team has been improving staff engagement for companies.

## Project requirements
One of the ways we accomplish this is by providing a review system for managers and supervisors to review employees at the end of jobs. You will be designing that system for this project. At a minimum, your review system needs to accomplish four things:

1. For a given job manager/supervisor, list all staff that have worked on their jobs by client and job
2. Have an intake form for reviews that includes fields for:
    * Staff to review
    * Client and job name
    * Rating selection (thumbs up, okay, and thumbs down)
    * Most exhibited core value selection (expertise, relationship, innovation, presentation)
    * What went well
    * What could have gone better
3. For a given staff, display the reviews they have received
4. Display all reviews as if someone from leadership wanted to see all reviews in the company

The necessary data for this project is located in JSON format [here](#). Additionally, this needs to be accessible on a windows machine whether by browser, desktop application, or CLI tool. The above list is the minimum requirements, but there is no true ceiling to what could be a part of this project. As time allows, feel free to add more to any portion of your project. Be careful however not to overwhelm any feature and hinder chances of adoption by our users. A couple of data points leadership typically are interested in would be total hours worked on a project and a metric called realization - the percentage of how much was billed divided by how much could have been billed (can go over 100%).

## Language requirements
Finally, we use Python because it is easy to learn and incredibly versatile. If you are reading this email, that means you either know Python or we feel confident you could learn it. Complete this project in whatever way will best showcase your skills. Use any and all resources at your disposal.
